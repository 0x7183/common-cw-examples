# Terra Deposit Starter Pack

This is a simple template to manage `UST` deposit into a Smart Contract

You can Interact with this Smart Contract using this **TESTNET** address:
```

```
## ExecuteMsg

### Deposit
```
{"deposit":{}}
```
### Withdraw all

```
{"withdrawal":{"id":"1"}}
```

## Query

### Get Deposits

```
{"get_deposits":{"address":"terra1umw8s7n8pzcnwn6n5pnr9574gy739nuwy4rk2a"}}
```

# Common-cw-Examples

In my opinion learning how to develop a Smart Contract for Terra is hard due to lack of examples, so I decided to share some of my works.
