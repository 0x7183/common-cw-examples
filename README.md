# Common-cw-Examples

In my opinion learning how to develop a Smart Contract for Terra is hard due to lack of examples, so I decided to share some of my works.

## Examples

This repository contains the following examples

- `deposit` a simple SC where you can deposit and withdraw UST
- `send` a simple SC that send UST to another address
- `staking` a simple SC that stake Luna (TODO)
- `interact` a simple SC that interact with Anchor Protocol
