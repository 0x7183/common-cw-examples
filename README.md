# Common-cw-Examples

In my opinion learning how to develop a Smart Contract for Terra is hard due to lack of examples, so I decided to share some of my works.
All the code in this repository is NOT AUDITED, use it at your own risk.
If you'd like to collaborate with me feel free to ping me in the Terra Discord `@7183`
